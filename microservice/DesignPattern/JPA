EntityManager is a key interface responsible for managing the persistence context.
It provides methods to interact with the database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on entities.
EntityManager is a central component in JPA for managing the lifecycle of entities and their interactions with the database.

Entity Management:
Persist: Adds a new entity to the database.
Merge: Updates an existing entity or saves a detached entity.
Remove: Deletes an entity from the database.
Find: Retrieves an entity based on its primary key.
Refresh: Reloads the entity state from the database to synchronize with the current database state.

Transaction Management:
Begin Transaction: Starts a new transaction.
Commit: Commits the current transaction, persisting changes to the database.
Rollback: Rolls back the current transaction, undoing changes.

Query Execution:
Create Query: Creates queries to fetch or manipulate data using JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or native SQL.
Named Queries: Allows the use of predefined queries stored in metadata.

Context Management:
Flush: Synchronizes the persistence context with the underlying database.
Clear: Clears the persistence context, detaching all entities.
Close: Closes the EntityManager, releasing resources.
