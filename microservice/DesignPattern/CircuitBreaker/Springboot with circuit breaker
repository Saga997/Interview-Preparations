What is Resilience4j?
Resilience4j is a lightweight, easy-to-use fault tolerance library inspired by
Netflix Hystrix. It provides various features.

Circuit Breaker — fault tolerance
Rate Limiter — block too many requests
Time Limiter — limit time while calling remote operations
Retry Mechanism — automatic retry for failed operations
Bulkhead — limit number of concurrent requests
Cache — store results of costly remote operations

I’m going to implement a simple inter service communication scenario using two services called
loan-service and rate-service.

Technical details:
Spring Boot with H2 in-memory DB, JPA, Hibernate, Actuator, Resilience4j

Scenario:
Loan service can fetch Loans saved in DB and each loan object has loan type. There are separate interest rate
percentages according to the loan type. So, Rate service is having those Rate object details with it’s name.
