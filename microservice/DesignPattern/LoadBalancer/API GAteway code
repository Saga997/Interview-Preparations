AWS API Gateway is a managed service that provides routing, load balancing, security, and API management
features. It's integrated with other AWS services like Lambda, EC2, ECS, and EKS, making it suitable for cloud-native
microservices architectures.

How AWS API Gateway Routes and Balances Load:
API Gateway uses stages, resources, and methods to define routes.
Integrations connect routes to backend services like Lambda, HTTP endpoints, or other AWS services.
Load balancing is achieved by integrating with AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB),
which distribute requests across multiple instances of the target service.
