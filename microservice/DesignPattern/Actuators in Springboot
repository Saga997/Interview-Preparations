Spring Boot Actuator is a powerful feature that helps developers monitor and manage Spring Boot applications by
exposing production-ready endpoints.

Health Checks: Provides health status of the application, including information about databases, message brokers,
and other components.
Metrics: Exposes key application metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, garbage collection, and
custom application metrics.
Environment Information: Displays environment properties, configuration properties, and system properties.
Loggers: Allows you to view and configure log levels dynamically.
Application Uptime: Provides information on how long the application has been running.
HTTP Trace: Shows details of HTTP requests and responses (useful for debugging).
Beans: Lists all Spring beans in the application context, showing their types and configurations.
Thread Dumps: Captures and displays current thread activity, which is useful for diagnosing performance issues.
