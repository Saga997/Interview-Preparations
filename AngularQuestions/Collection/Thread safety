Use Concurrent Collections for Performance:
Prefer using ConcurrentHashMap over Hashtable or a synchronized HashMap.
For thread-safe lists, use CopyOnWriteArrayList if your application is mostly read-heavy, or otherwise
manage synchronization manually.
Use blocking queues (like LinkedBlockingQueue) for producer-consumer problems.

Synchronize External Operations:
Even if you use synchronized collections (like Vector or synchronized wrappers), some operations that require
multiple steps (like iterating over a collection) are not thread-safe. For such operations, you should manually
synchronize the collection externally.

List<Integer> synchronizedList = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());

// External synchronization during iteration
synchronized(synchronizedList) {
    for (Integer i : synchronizedList) {
        // Safe iteration
    }
}
