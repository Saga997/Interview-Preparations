Real-World Examples and Usage Scenarios

he Builder Pattern in Java is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step.
It is useful when a class has many optional parameters or when object construction involves several steps, making it
 difficult to manage with a constructor or static factory methods.

Here are some practical scenarios where the Builder Pattern is commonly applied:

Creating Complex Configuration Objects:

For example, configuring an HTTP request with various optional headers, parameters, and body content.
Constructing GUI Components:

Building complex graphical user interface (GUI) components with many optional settings and configurations.
Building Database Connection Objects:

Configuring database connections with multiple optional parameters like timeout settings, SSL configurations,
and pooling options.
Generating Reports:

Creating reports with various sections, formats, and data sources that need to be assembled step by step.
Constructing Immutable Data Structures:

Building immutable objects where all fields are set during construction, such as configuration settings or data transfer objects (DTOs).
