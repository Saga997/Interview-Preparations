The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many
\relationship between objects, where one object (the "subject") changes state, and all
its dependents (the "observers") are notified and updated automatically.
This pattern is useful for implementing distributed event handling systems and is commonly
used in scenarios where multiple objects need to be informed about changes to the state of
another object.

With the observer pattern, we can subscribe certain objects, the observers,to another object,
 called the observable. Whenever an event occurs, the observable notifies all its observers!
