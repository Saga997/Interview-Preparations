descending order
SELECT * FROM Employee ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;

3.Write a query to fetch 50% records from employee table
SELECT * FROM Employee LIMIT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employee) / 2;

4.find the third largest salary from Employee table
SELECT salary from EMPLOYEE ORDER BY Salary LIMIT 2,1;
(LIMIT 4,1) - select one row after 4th row ie 5th row

5.Write a query to find the Nth highest salary from the table without using top /limit keyword
SELECT salary FROM Employee e1 WHERE (N - 1) = ( SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salary)FROM Employee e2

    3rd highest salary.

e1.salary <= e2.salary) ORDER BY e1.salary; // MAXIMUM

13. Write a query to retrieve list of employees working in the same department
SELECT DISTINCT e1.empid ,e1.name, e1.department FROM employee e1, employee e2 where e1.department= e2.department
AND e1.empID != e2.empID;

 create unique index <index name> on <table_name> column <column_name>;

21.Create a table
CREATE TABLE STUDENT(s_id INT(5) PRIMARY KEY,name VARCHAR(255),address VARCHAR(255));
INSERT INTO STUDENT(s_id,name,address) value (1,"HARSH","PUNE");

22.CREATE VIEW
CREATE VIEW DetailsView AS SELECT name,address FROM student WHERE s_id<5;

23. To view data from DETAILS view;
SELECT * FROM DetailsView;

24. Write a query to concatenate three columns, name, salary and email where salary is greater than 10000;
