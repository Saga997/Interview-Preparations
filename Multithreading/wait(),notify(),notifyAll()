why wait() notify() notifyAll() method is present in Object class and not in Thread class
--> The methods wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() are present in the Object class instead of the Thread class
because they are designed to operate on an object's monitor (or intrinsic lock), which every object in Java possesses.

 The wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods control the behavior of threads with respect to an object's lock.
 Since every object can be a lock, these methods are part of the Object class

 Thread Interaction with Object's Monitor: The wait() method causes the current thread to release the lock and
 wait until another thread invokes notify() or notifyAll() on the same object to wake it up. Similarly,
 notify() and notifyAll() notify one or all waiting threads, respectively, that they can re-acquire the lock
 and proceed. This interaction happens at the object level, not at the thread level.

 Thread Class Represents Behavior, Not Synchronization: The Thread class represents the concept of an individual
 thread of execution. It doesn't control object-level synchronization or the object's intrinsic lock. Since wait(),
  notify(), and notifyAll() are synchronization mechanisms tied to the object lock, it makes more sense for them to
  be in the Object class.

Multiple Threads Can Wait on One Object: In Java, multiple threads may be waiting for the same object's lock.
The wait() method puts the current thread in a waiting state for that particular object.
The notify() and notifyAll() methods are used to signal waiting threads that the objectâ€™s state may have changed,
allowing threads to proceed. Since threads are waiting for a particular object's monitor, the object, not the thread,
