Create Docker Images for Microservices
Dockerfile for each microservice. This file contains the instructions to create the Docker image.

# Start with a base image with Java
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the built JAR file into the container
COPY target/my-microservice.jar my-microservice.jar

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 8080

# Define the entry point for the container
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "my-microservice.jar"]

Build the Docker Image: Run the following command in the directory containing the Dockerfile:
docker build -t my-microservice:latest .

Tag and Push the Docker Image to a Container Registry
(e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Container Registry):

# Tag the image
docker tag my-microservice:latest your-repo/my-microservice:latest

# Log in to your Docker registry
docker login

# Push the image
docker push your-repo/my-microservice:latest
