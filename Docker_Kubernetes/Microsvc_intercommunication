Ensure Microservices Can Communicate with Each Other
Microservices in Kubernetes typically communicate using services that abstract access to the pods.

Create Kubernetes Services for Each Microservice: Define a service for each microservice to expose it within the cluster.

Example service.yaml:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-microservice
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: my-microservice
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080


Enable Inter-Communication Using Service Names: Kubernetes allows microservices to communicate using their
service names. For example, a microservice can communicate with another microservice by making requests
to http://my-microservice.default.svc.cluster.local (assuming the service is in the default namespace).

Use Environment Variables or Configuration Files: Use environment variables or configuration files to define
the service URLs, allowing each microservice to discover and communicate with others.
