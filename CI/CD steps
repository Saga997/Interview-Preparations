setting up Jenkins, configuring the pipeline,
integrating source code management, building, testing, and deploying your application.

Set Up Jenkins
Install Jenkins:

Prerequisites: Jenkins requires Java (preferably Java 11 or above).
Installation: You can install Jenkins on various platforms, including Linux, Windows, or macOS.
The installation steps differ based on the operating system. Below is an example of installing Jenkins on Ubuntu:

# Install Java
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y

# Add Jenkins repository and install Jenkins
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y

# Start Jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins


Access Jenkins Dashboard:

Once Jenkins is installed, access the Jenkins dashboard using the URL: http://<your-server-ip>:8080.
Unlock Jenkins using the initial admin password found in /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword.
Install the recommended plugins or select specific ones based on your needs.

Set Up Jenkins Environment:

Configure Global Tools: Set up necessary tools like JDK, Git, and Maven under
Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration.
Create Credentials: Add credentials (e.g., Git credentials, SSH keys, AWS credentials) under Manage Jenkins >
Manage Credentials to access external resources.
