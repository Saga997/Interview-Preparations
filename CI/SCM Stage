 Configure Source Code Management (SCM)
Integrate Jenkins with SCM:

Jenkins supports several SCMs like Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc. The most commonly used is Git.
For integration, install necessary plugins such as Git Plugin or GitHub Integration Plugin.
Create a New Job or Pipeline:

Navigate to Dashboard > New Item and select Pipeline.
Provide a name for the job, and select Pipeline type.
Configure SCM Settings:

In the job configuration, set the repository URL and credentials.
Set branch specifications if necessary (e.g., main, develop, or feature branches).
Example SCM Configuration for Git:

groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git'
            }
        }
    }
}
