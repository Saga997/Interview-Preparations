Wildcards in Java are represented by the question mark (?) and are used in Generics to represent an unknown type.
They are a powerful feature in Java that provides flexibility when working with classes, interfaces, and methods that
use Generics, allowing for more generic and reusable code.

Unbounded Wildcards (?): Represents an unknown type without any bounds.
Upper-Bounded Wildcards (? extends T): Restricts the unknown type to be a subtype of a specific
class or interface (T).
Lower-Bounded Wildcards (? super T): Restricts the unknown type to be a supertype of a
specific class (T).

public class UnboundedWildcardExample {
    // Method that accepts a list of any type
    public static void printList(List<?> list) {
        for (Object element : list) {
            System.out.println(element);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> intList = List.of(1, 2, 3);
        List<String> strList = List.of("a", "b", "c");

        printList(intList); // Works with List<Integer>
        printList(strList); // Works with List<String>
    }
}
