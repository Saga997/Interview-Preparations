Collections: Collections are data structures that hold and organize objects, such as List, Set, and Map. They are part
of the java.util package and provide ways to store, retrieve, and manipulate groups of objects.

Streams: Streams are sequences of data elements that allow you to perform operations on data in a functional style,
such as filtering, mapping, and reducing. They are part of the java.util.stream package and focus on processing data
rather than storing it.

Collections: Focus on storing objects. For example, a List can store multiple elements that can be accessed,
modified, and iterated over.
Streams: Focus on processing data. Streams do not hold the data but create a pipeline of operations to be
performed on the data (e.g., filtering, mapping).

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
for (Integer number : numbers) {
    System.out.println(number); // External iteration
}

numbers.stream().forEach(System.out::println); // Internal iteration
